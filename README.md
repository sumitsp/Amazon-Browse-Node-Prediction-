# Predicting Browse Nodes of different Amazon Products 
Amazon catalog consists of billions of products that belong to thousands of browse nodes (each browse node represents a collection of items for sale). Browse nodes are used to help customer navigate through our website and classify products to product type groups. Hence, it is important to predict the node assignment at the time of listing of the product or when the browse node information is absent. We  will use product metadata to classify products into browse nodes. You will have access to product title, description, bullet points etc. and labels for ~3MM products to train and test.
